# Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Separation of ODK and ODK-X Projects

July 1, 2020

As decided at a convening held in October 2019 in Seattle, WA, the members of the Open Data Kit Project Management Committee (PMC), the ODK Technical Steering Committee (TSC-1), and ODK-X Technical Steering Committee (TSC-2), agree to split the Open Data Kit entity into two new and separate entities representing the ODK and ODK-X projects. In good faith, the above parties agree that:

1. The tools and associated assets that are currently being supervised by “TSC-1” will be controlled and supported by a new independent entity. The “TSC-1/GetODK” entity will use the term ODK for it’s branding.
1. The tools and associated assets that are currently being supervised by “TSC-2” will be controlled and supported by a new independent entity. The “TSC-2/ODK-X” entity will use the term ODK-X for it’s branding.
1. Both the “TSC-1/GetODK” entity and “TSC-2/ODK-X” will become initial members of DSFSG, a newly formed umbrella organization dedicated to open-source software for social good.
1. The names “Open Data Kit”, “ODK”, and “ODK-X” are a shared historic asset that will not be exclusively “owned” by a single entity. They will be used in a good faith according to points 1 and 2.
1. All existing code and projects with an Apache 2 license will continue to use the Apache 2 license.
1. Any new software tool written after the “Open Data Kit” entity split that uses any of the shared historic names must use an OSI recognized, permissive open-source license, with all contributions remaining freely available.
1. The name "Open Data Kit" and associated assets will be retired and only used insofar as to redirect people seeking either of the two aforementioned projects or for historical descriptions and references. All associated asset account credentials will be maintained such that the varying parties to this agreement still have access to and the ability to update the redirections or historical descriptions and references.
