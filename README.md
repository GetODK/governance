# Governance Overview

The ODK project is governed by Get ODK Inc. under the supervision of its Technical Steering Committee.

These groups are guided first and foremost by the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [Mission and Values](MISSION-AND-VALUES.md). The remainder of this document lays out how specific decisions are made.

## Get ODK Inc.

ODK has become a large and vibrant open source project, depended on by millions of users for critical data gathering needs. As such, the project requires substantial work to maintain. This work is best performed performed in a steady, reliable fashion by a concrete, well-resourced entity. In recognition of these facts, Get ODK Inc., a corporation in the U.S. State of California, was formed to serve as the primary, day-to-day manager and steward of the project.

Get ODK Inc. is a for-profit entity that strives to sustain its operations through ODK-related business activites (or otherwise) while committing to preserving ODK as a healthy and bona fide open source project.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) represents the ODK community of end users and implementers. It reviews and gives feedback on major roadmap decisions, new designs, specfications, features, and protocol changes.

The TSC pre-dates the formation of Get ODK Inc. When Get ODK Inc. was created, the TSC agreed to become an advisory body to the new entity. Get ODK Inc. commits to maintaining the TSC indefinitely as part of its commitment to the open source community.

The TSC's membership and decision making process are defined in the [TSC's internal governance policy](TSC-GOVERNANCE.md).

## Code

As ODK is an open source project, anybody may file issues on or propose code changes to any of the various ODK repositories. Proposed code changes must be approved by a project Committer.

### Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Commit/write access allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project-related activities by giving them direct access to the project's resources.

Get ODK Inc. awards Committer status to individuals making significant and valuable contributions to the project. Current Committers and the TSC may also suggest individuals deserving of Committer access, but Get ODK Inc. has final say.

_Note: If you make a significant contribution and are not considered for commit/write access on the appropriate resource, file an issue, post on the forum, or contact a TSC member directly and it will be brought up at the next TSC meeting._

If a Committer becomes inactive, having not participated substantially in the project for six months or more, their Committer status will be revoked. They may regain status again by resuming substantial participation.

Notwithstanding any of the above, Get ODK Inc. may revoke the Committer status of any Committer at its sole discretion.

The current list of Committers is at [https://github.com/orgs/getodk/people](https://github.com/orgs/getodk/people).

### Change approval

Proposed code changes must be approved by a project Committer with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change.

In the case of changes proposed by an existing Committer, an additional Committer is required for review.

Consensus should be sought if there is disagreement between multiple Committers around a particular modification. Committers may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications or modifications that have not found consensus to the TSC for discussion. In the absence of consensus on the TSC, Get ODK Inc. has final say.

## Tools

ODK is a community that produces free and open-source software for collecting, managing, and using data in resource-constrained environments. The community may allow certain other projects adhering to that vision to join ODK in order to contribute to and benefit from its brand, community, and vitality. The [Tool Governance](TOOL-GOVERNANCE.md) document defines the specifics of how this can happen.

## Amendments

Revisions to any document in this repository must be approved by both Get ODK Inc. and the Technical Steering Committee. Even though these documents exist within an ODK repository, this requirement supersedes the code governance policy above. Committers should not effect changes to documents in this repository without the approval of Get ODK Inc. and the TSC. Exceptions may be made for small changes such as typographical errors.
